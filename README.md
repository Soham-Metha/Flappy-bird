Originally created in the C Programming Language, a character based game. Later recreated it in Java and gave it a GUI.<br>

# Flappy Bird

The first game i created using the Unity Game Engine. 
It includes Animations and audios as well. 
Most of the Graphics were taken from various sources across the internet, they don't belong to me.
